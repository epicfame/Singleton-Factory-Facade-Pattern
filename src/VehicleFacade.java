/*
 * Facade Pattern
 * The faÃ§ade pattern is used to hide a class and the operations performed by that class using other classes. 
 * So in the example coding, we don't need to know classes like Car and Bicycle. 
 * Then the Car and Bicycle classes can be overcome with patterns. 
 * Then another function of this pattern is to wrap it to make it simpler -> because we only have to deal with 1 class.
